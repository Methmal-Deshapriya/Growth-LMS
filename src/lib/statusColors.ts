/**
 * Central status → color registry. Every status badge anywhere in the admin
 * system (services, categories, courses, sessions, curriculum delivery,
 * enrollments, payments, certificates, student projects) is colored from
 * here, not with its own one-off Tailwind classes — so the whole system's
 * status language changes in exactly one place.
 *
 * The actual colors live in `TONE`, keyed by what the color *means*, not
 * which entity it's on. Each status list below just says which tone that
 * status carries; two different entities' "ARCHIVED" or "COMPLETED" read
 * as the same color for the same reason a stop sign is red everywhere.
